Discere is an educational project designed to strengthen the learning of multiplication tables from 1 to 10 in elementary school students. This proposal combines the use of an educational workbook that introduces and practices each multiplication table with educational software that contains a video game that reinforces the content through short mini-games and a scoring and star system to track progress.
